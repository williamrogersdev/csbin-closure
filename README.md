What is Closure? 


Closures are confusing because they are are going on under the hood of JavaScipt 

When you use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this intentionally.

Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they have already used them unknowingly many times â€” and it is likely that this is true for yourself, too. So learning closures is less about understanding a new concept and more about recognizing something you have already been doing for a while.


You have a closure when a function accesses variables defined outside of it.
