Challenge 5
Write a function after that takes the number of times the callback needs to be called before being executed as the first parameter and the callback as the second parameter.


function after(count, callback) {
  
  
 let counterOfTimesCalled = 0;
  function innerClosure() {
    counterOfTimesCalled++;
    if (counterOfTimesCalled === count) {
      callback();
    }
  }
  
  return innerClosure;
